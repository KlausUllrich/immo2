I am trying to fix this error when I import this json file to the project: Fehler beim Laden der Datei: bauzeitA is 
  not defined. The json is: /home/klaus/Downloads/immo-test_8_working.json  This seems to be a highly complex error 
  that has not been fixed for several sessions. The issue also occurs in the console when switching from mode "Klaus/Kevin" to "Gemeinsam", but not the other way around.Create an extensive swarm of agents to analyse this issue by creating an orchestrator that will create relevant sub-agents.
